        You're more than just a name I say softly in my thoughts. You're a story I'm proud to read, one line at a time. With each day that passes, my admiration for you only grows stronger.

      <p>
        You've got 3-4 months left in school. After that? Anything is possible. I believe you'll conquer the software world — one code, one dream at a time. Your dedication and brilliance shine through everything you do.

        I'm someone walking parallel in this journey — coding, building, dreaming... and admiring you silently.

      <h3>My Wish For You</h3>
      <p>May you become the woman you've always dreamed of — strong, kind, brilliant. The world may not know you yet, but one day it will. And I'll always know: you were magic from the start.</p>
      <p>When you smile, remember someone thinks about that smile every day. When you doubt yourself, remember someone never doubts your abilities.</p>
      <p>I hope our paths continue to run parallel until they finally meet.</p>
